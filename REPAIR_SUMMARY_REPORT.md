# Database and API Repair Summary Report

## Issue Analysis
The user reported "lot of feature not working check and fix db and related file" indicating widespread functionality issues in the attendance system.

## Problems Identified
1. **Database Structure Issues:**
   - Missing critical columns in attendance table (marked_by, created_at, updated_at)
   - Missing status column in employees table
   - Missing biometric_sync_status table
   - Missing device_settings table
   - Missing leave_history table
